<!--ABOUT-->
## About
This is my first web development project. In searching for ideas for beginner projects, I saw weather apps being mentioned frequently. I checked out several good projects other people created and decided I wanted to do something a bit different. I love cute things, cats, and making digital art, so I thought it would be fun to combine those things with my interest in web development. 

There were also a couple things I noticed weren't featured in other beginner apps that went to the top of my list for what I wanted to implement in my own project, specifically an autocomplete search bar and accuracy when searching for cities. 

So, I took my ideas, spent a ton of time drawing (never doing that again), spent even longer teaching myself JavaScript, CSS and Vue, as well as furthering the knowledge I did have of HTML, and voila! kittycaSts was created! ðŸ˜º

kittycaSts is still a work in progress, but I've gotten most of it completed now. Updates to come!
